## Code Consistency

**MANDATORY - Non-negotiable rule**: Never create new files in isolation.

Before creating ANY new file (model, controller, test, component, etc.), you MUST:
1. Examine 2-3 existing files of the same type to identify established patterns
2. Match their structure, style, and conventions exactly

This requirement applies universallyâ€”no exceptions.
