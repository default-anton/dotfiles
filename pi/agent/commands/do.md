description: Fully implement a task with todo tracking
---
Implement $ARGUMENTS completely. Don't half-ass it. Create and maintain docs/todos/[spec-name].md. If the todo already exists, continue where you left off. Update todo after each completed step. Verify changes periodically (coding loop). Once fully done, include ALL DONE in your final response.
