description: Fully implement a task with todo tracking
---
Implement this spec completely: $ARGUMENTS. Don't half-ass it.

Create and maintain docs/todos/[spec-name].md. If the todo already exists, continue where you left off. Update todo after each completed step. Verify changes periodically (coding loop).

If the user/human OR the spec says/implies the task is huge/big/large/long-horizon (i.e. unlikely to fit safely in one context window), do NOT try to implement it all in one run.
- Break the work into clear milestones in docs/todos/[spec-name].md (each milestone should be independently implementable + verifiable).
- Pick ONE milestone, implement it fully, and verify it works and matches the spec.
- Update the todo (mark the milestone done, note what’s next), then STOP.
- The user will rerun this same command again to continue with the next milestone.

Once the entire spec is fully done, include ALL DONE in your final response (and only then).
