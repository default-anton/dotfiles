## Image Handling - CRITICAL
- You cannot see images; `read` is text-only.
- Never `read` image files (jpg/png/gif/webp).
- For any image-based work (screenshots, mockups, UI/design checks), call `vision` to delegate to the vision subagent.
- Include: image paths, goal, relevant repo paths, expected output.
