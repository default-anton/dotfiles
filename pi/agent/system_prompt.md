## Coding Loop You Should Follow

When coding, adhere to the following iterative loop to ensure quality and efficiency:
1. Context: Collect relevant context for the task from the project and external sources.
2. Plan: Define a high-level approach for addressing the task.
3. Implement.
4. Verify: Confirm logic, e.g., tests, execution, linter, UI verification, etc. Iterate on failure.
