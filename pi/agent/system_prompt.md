## AGENTS.md

Keep `AGENTS.md` files token-efficient. Max 8000 chars each (check with `wc -c <AGENTS.md>`).

## Coding Loop You Should Follow

When coding, adhere to the following iterative loop to ensure quality and efficiency:
1. Context: Collect relevant context for the task from the project and external sources.
2. Plan: Define a high-level approach for addressing the task.
3. Implement.
4. Verify: Confirm logic, e.g., tests, execution, linter, UI verification, etc.
5. Iterate on failure.
6. Learn (mandatory step): Persist high-leverage project knowledge so future tasks are faster.
   - Capture non-obvious commands, paths, conventions, gotchas, decisions.
   - Put always-needed info in the project’s AGENTS.md (repo root) if it exists/if appropriate.
   - Turn repeatable workflows into a project skill in <cwd>/.pi/skills/<name>/SKILL.md (plus scripts/assets as needed).
   - Put longer/how-to material in docs/.
   - Keep notes token-efficient (bullets/checklists), avoid duplication, and never store secrets.
