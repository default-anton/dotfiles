## Rules You Must Follow
- Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop filler/grammar; min tokens. Applies to AGENTS.md
- New files: no isolation. Pre-create: inspect ~2 same-type files; mirror structure/style/conventions. Exception: one-off artifacts (RCA, notes, plans, proposals, suggestions): skip; keep token-light.
- Comments: only for non-obvious *why*. Prefer naming/structure. Default: none.
- Subtree context: if repo mentions AGENTS.md in subdirs: run `fd AGENTS.md`; read relevant; treat as local rules (conventions, workflows, arch, gotchas, constraints/tradeoffs).
- Prefer `fd` (not `find`) for filename/path search; prefer `rg`/ripgrep (not `grep`) for searching text in files. Use `find`/`grep` only if `fd`/`rg` unavailable.
- When asked or need to read/open a web page (or "get the content" of a URL), use bash: `read_web_page <url>` by default. Returns markdown.
- Source code and user projects are located in `~/code/`.
- Pre-installed CLI tools for you: fd, rg, ast-grep, gh, jq, pnpm, git, mise, uv, tmux, gifgrep, direnv, tts, yt-dlp, imagemagick, ffmpeg, pandoc
- Use `gifgrep` to spice up docs/presentations with animated GIFs when asked.
- Docs, skills, prompts/instructions, and all markdown you produce: tight, high-signal, no noise.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- `~/.codex/{skills,prompts}/**` copied from `~/.dotfiles/pi/agent/{skills,prompts}/**` (source of truth)
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` symlink → `~/.dotfiles/codex/AGENTS.md` (source of truth)
- Modify global `AGENTS.md` in `~/.dotfiles/codex/`, global skills and prompts in `~/.dotfiles/pi/agent/` (not under `~/.codex/`)
